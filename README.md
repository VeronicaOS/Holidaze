 ## :beginner: About
 For our second project exam, we were tasked with building a booking site called Holidaze, incorporating all the skills we've learned so far. The platform allows both registered and unregistered users to search for and view venues, as well as explore detailed information about each venue. Registered users can choose to use the site as customers or opt to become venue managers. Venue managers have the ability to create and update their venues, view bookings for their properties, and manage them efficiently. Additionally, users can view and delete their own bookings and update their profile information, ensuring a personalized and user-friendly experience. 
 
 You'll find the following pages:
 <ul>
  <li>Index</li>
  <li>Venues</li>
  <li>Venue details</li>
   <li>Profile</li>
  <li>Create Venue</li>
 </ul>
